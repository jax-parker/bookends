# **Bookends - Project Portfolio 4**
#Contents
![Bookends](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlamq4hsk/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/Bookends/gpthbx2oqnladiwxfmeb)

Bookends is a fictitious website that provides ideas for any book clubs next best read. Designed 'mobile first' the site provides users with a book list with the book cover, title, author, genre, description and reviews that any site user can add once they have signed up/in. Once signed in the user can edit or delete their entries and see a list of books that they have added.

You can view the live site here - <a href="https://django-bookends.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Bookends </a>

# User Experience (UX)
## Site Aims
* To provide the user with a website that allows them to view books, descriptions and reviews
* To easily find books that may appeal to the members of their book club
* To allow users that have signed up to create, update, edit or delete their book entries
* To provide the admin user with the ability to delete users
* To provide a clear and appropriate response to any user inputs or actions

## Agile Methodology
The Agile Methodology was used to plan this project. This was implemented through Github and the Project Board, which can be seen here -

Through the use of the Kanban board in the projects view in Github, the project was divided into a few different sections:
[Kanban board github](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlamq4hsk/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/Bookends/a09ynmh81llpuojwpvds)

A User Story template was created then Github issues were used to create User Stories for the project.  

### User Stories

**User Story: Account Registration (1)**
* As a Site User I can register an account so that I can view books or add a review

**User Story: LogIn/LogOut/SignUp (2)**
* As a Returning Site User I can log in, view books in detail, create my own book listing and review and log out.

**User Story: View Book List (3)**
* As a Site User I can view a list of books so that I can see the book cover, title and description.

**User Story: Book Detail (4)**
* As a Site User I can click on a book in the list view so I can read more details and the review.

**User Story: Create A Review (5)**
* As a Site User I can create a book review so that other members can see my reviews.

**User Story: Manage Book Reviews (6)**
* As a Site User I can create, read, update & delete books so that I can manage my book content

**User Story: Search For Books (7)**
* As a Site User I can search for books using key words so that I don't have to scroll through the books to get to the one I want

## Site Structure
From the home page, Bookends website has three pages visible in the navigation bar plus the search bar; Home, Sign Up and Login. Once signed in the nav bar then
has Book List, Add A Review, Your Books and Logout. This ensures that only users that have signed in are authorised to see the book list, add a review and the book list they have
added.

## Design Choices

### Logo
I used a website called [Looka](https://looka.com/logo-maker) to design the logo. It gives you a choice of colours, fonts and icons that you can choose which would be best for your design. 

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme was based around the logo I chose. Looka.com then provided me with a colour palette to use within my project.
![Colour Palette](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlamq4hsk/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/Bookends/hvrehpxk0j7gt6wveqfs)
### Typography
I chose two fonts from Google Fonts for this project, but both from the same family. Roboto Slab and Roboto (weight:300). Both are contrasting but clear to read.

# Testing
## Validation
### Html Validation
Html validation was done with [https://validator.w3.org/nu/](https://validator.w3.org/nu/).
On the website page, right click, view page source, copy code and paste into validator url after the =. Repeat for each page. You need to have the server running to view these pages. 
Results 
* [Home](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2F8000-jaxparker-bookends-r6l7rti2x81.ws-eu102.gitpod.io)
* [Book List](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2F8000-jaxparker-bookends-r6l7rti2x81.ws-eu102.gitpod.io%2Fbooks%2F)
* [Book Detail](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2F8000-jaxparker-bookends-r6l7rti2x81.ws-eu102.gitpod.io%2Fbooks%2F17%2F)

The source code threw in an extra p tag which was not in my orignal code. I asked on Slack and got the advice to remove the tag from my code and just leave the {}. This worked and cleared the error.

### CSS Validation

The stylesheet was validated using [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
![CSS Validator Check](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlamq4hsk/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/Bookends/cydwtkzzwrdhq2el8oxo)
Errors: None

### Python Validation

Python code that I have written was validated using [Code institues Python validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#)
Extra white space and more than two line errors were found and corrected.

## Bugs
* I had made the mistake of pushing my repo to git hub before adding env.py to my gitignore file which stopped my env from 'greying' and becoming secret. Firstly I had to remove the cached version with git rm --cached env.py. I then had to delete the file and commit, then recreated it. I then had to generate new secrets as my old ones had been exposed in github, recreate a superuser and add books back in to user accounts.

* I originally only copied over the sign up, log in and out AllAuth files as I mistakenly thought this would be ok but this caused a 403 forbidden error in my code. Student Support explained that as allauth had a lot of things going on in the background it was advisable to copy all of the allauth files over even if you're not using them. I did this and this resolved the issue.

* Search that doesn't exist returned a TypeError message. So I added an {% empty %} in the books.html template and entered a message and button to return the user to the books list page.

* After running the git rm --cached env.py as stated above, this caused issues in gitpod, bringing through old workspaces which were resolved by deleting old workspaces but then I could not push to git as it wanted me to pull first as I'd unknowingly completed work in old workspaces. I ran git pull and got an error saying I had divergent branches. I then ran git config pull.rebase false to pull data from my repo, commit and push.


# Deployment

## Deployment to Heroku

### 1. Creating the Django Project
* If development if being done locally: Activate your virtual environment
* To ensure the virtual environment is not tracked by version control, add .venv to the .gitignore file.
* Install Django and gunicorn: `pip3 install django gunicorn`
* Install supporting database libraries dj_database_url and psycopg2 library: `pip install dj_database_url psycopg2`
* Install Cloudinary libraries to manage static files: `pip install dj-3-cloudinary-storage`
* Create file for requirements: `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
* Create project:`django-admin startproject project_name .`
* Create app: `python manage.py startapp app_name`
* Add app to list of `installed apps` in settings.py file: `'app_name'`
* Migrate changes: `python manage.py migrate`
* Test server works locally: `python manage.py runserver`

### 2. Create your Heroku app
* Navigate to the Heroku website
* Create a Heroku account by entering your email address and a password (or login if you have one already).
* Activate the account through the authentication email sent to your email account
* Click the **new button** on the top right corner of the screen and select create a new app from the dropdown menu.
* Enter a unique name for the application.
* Select the appropriate region for the application.
* Click create app
* In the Heroku dashboard click on the Resources tab
* Scroll down to Add-Ons, search for and select 'Heroku Postgres'
* In the Settings tab, scroll down to 'Reveal Config Vars' and copy the text in the box beside DATABASE_URL.

### 3. Set up Environment Variables
* In you IDE create a new env.py file in the top level directory
* Add env.py to the .gitignore file
* In env.py import the os library
* In env.py add `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]` = "Paste in the text link copied above from Heroku DATABASE_URL"
* In env.py add `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own random secret key"
* In env.py add `os.environ["CLOUDINARY]` = "Paste in the API Environment Variable link from Cloudinary and remove the prefix"
* In Heroku Settings tab Config Vars enter the same secret key created in env.py by entering 'SECRET_KEY' in the box for 'KEY' and your randomly created secret key in the 'value' box.

### 4. Setting up settings.py

* In your Django 'settings.py' file type:

 ```
 from pathlib import Path
 import os
 import dj_database_url

 if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
  import env
 ```
* Remove the default insecure secret key in settings.py and replace with the link to the secret key variable in Heroku by typing: `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get(SECRET_KEY)`
* Comment out the `DATABASES` section in settings.py and replace with:
```
DATABASES = {
  'default': 
  dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }`
```
* Create a Cloudinary account and from the 'Dashboard' in Cloudinary copy your url into the env.py file by typing: `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://<insert-your-url>"`
* In Heroku  add cloudinary url to 'config vars'
* In Heroku config vars add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with value of '1' (note: this must be removed for final deployment)
* Add Cloudinary libraries to the installed apps section of settings.py file:
 ```
 'cloudinary_storage'
 'django.contrib.staticfiles''
 'cloudinary'
 ```
* Connect Cloudinary to the Django app in `settings.py`:
```
STATIC_URL = '/static'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'STATIC')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE =
'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
* Link file to the templates directory in Heroku 
* Place under the BASE_DIR: TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,
'templates')
```
* Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR. Place within the TEMPLATES array: `'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`
* Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS: ```ALLOWED_HOSTS =
['rhi-book-nook.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']```
*Create Procfile at the top level of the file structure and insert the following:
    ``` web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi ```

* Make an initial commit and push the code to the GitHub Repository.
    ```git add .```
    ```git commit -m "Initial deployment"```
    ```git push```

### 5. Heroku Deployment: 
* Click Deploy tab in Heroku
* In the 'Deployment method' section select 'Github' and click the 'connect to Github' button to confirm.
* In the 'search' box enter the Github repository name for the project
* Click search and then click connect to link the heroku app with the Github repository. The box will confirm that heroku is connected to the repository.

### 6. Final Deployment
In the IDE: 
* When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in `env.py` 
* In Heroku settings config vars change the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC value to 0
* Because DEBUG must be switched to True for development and False for production it is recommended that only manual deployment is used in Heroku. 
* To manually deploy click the button 'Deploy Branch'. The default 'main' option in the dropdown menu should be selected in both cases. When the app is deployed a message 'Your app was successfully deployed' will be shown. Click 'view' to see the deployed app in the browser.
