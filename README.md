# **Bookends - Project Portfolio 4**

![Bookends](/static/readme/screenshots.png)

Bookends is a website that provides ideas for any book clubs next best read. Designed 'mobile first' the site provides users with a book list with the book cover, title, author, genre,
description and review that any site user can add once they have signed up/in. Once signed in the user can edit or delete their entries and see a list of books that they have added.

You can view the live site here - <a href="https://django-bookends.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Bookends </a>

# User Experience (UX)
## Site Aims
* To provide the user with a website that allows them to view books, descriptions and reviews
* To easily find books that may appeal to the members of their book club
* To allow users that have signed up to create, update, edit or delete their book entries
* To provide the admin user with the ability to delete users
* To provide a clear and appropriate response to any user inputs or actions

## Agile Methodology
The Agile Methodology was used to plan this project. This was implemented through Github and the Project Board, which can be seen here -

Through the use of the Kanban board in the projects view in Github, the project was divided into a few different sections:
![Kanban board github](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwvsz0fug/image/upload/v1690981983/kanban-board_vr0jps.png)

A User Story template was created then Github issues were used to create User Stories for the project.  

### User Stories

**User Story: Account Registration**
* As a Site User I can register an account so that I can view books or add a review

**User Story: LogIn/LogOut/SignUp**
* As a Returning Site User I can log in, view books in detail, create my own book listing and review and log out.

**User Story: View Book List**
* As a Site User I can view a list of books so that I can see the book cover, title and description.

**User Story: Book Detail**
* As a Site User I can click on a book in the list view so I can read more details and the review.

**User Story: Create A Review**
* As a Site User I can create a book review so that other members can see my reviews.

**User Story: Manage Book Reviews**
* As a Site User I can create, read, update & delete books so that I can manage my book content

**User Story: Search For Books**
* As a Site User I can search for books using key words so that I don't have to scroll through the books to get to the one I want

##Bugs

# Deployment

## Deployment to Heroku

### 1. Creating the Django Project
* If development if being done locally: Activate your virtual environment
* To ensure the virtual environment is not tracked by version control, add .venv to the .gitignore file.
* Install Django and gunicorn: `pip3 install django gunicorn`
* Install supporting database libraries dj_database_url and psycopg2 library: `pip install dj_database_url psycopg2`
* Install Cloudinary libraries to manage static files: `pip install dj-3-cloudinary-storage`
* Create file for requirements: `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
* Create project:`django-admin startproject project_name .`
* Create app: `python manage.py startapp app_name`
* Add app to list of `installed apps` in settings.py file: `'app_name'`
* Migrate changes: `python manage.py migrate`
* Test server works locally: `python manage.py runserver`

### 2. Create your Heroku app
* Navigate to the Heroku website
* Create a Heroku account by entering your email address and a password (or login if you have one already).
* Activate the account through the authentication email sent to your email account
* Click the **new button** on the top right corner of the screen and select create a new app from the dropdown menu.
* Enter a unique name for the application.
* Select the appropriate region for the application.
* Click create app
* In the Heroku dashboard click on the Resources tab
* Scroll down to Add-Ons, search for and select 'Heroku Postgres'
* In the Settings tab, scroll down to 'Reveal Config Vars' and copy the text in the box beside DATABASE_URL.

### 3. Set up Environment Variables
* In you IDE create a new env.py file in the top level directory
* Add env.py to the .gitignore file
* In env.py import the os library
* In env.py add `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]` = "Paste in the text link copied above from Heroku DATABASE_URL"
* In env.py add `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own random secret key"`
* In Heroku Settings tab Config Vars enter the same secret key created in env.py by entering 'SECRET_KEY' in the box for 'KEY' and your randomly created secret key in the 'value' box.

### 4. Setting up settings.py

* In your Django 'settings.py' file type:

 ```
 from pathlib import Path
 import os
 import dj_database_url

 if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
  import env
 ```
* Remove the default insecure secret key in settings.py and replace with the link to the secret key variable in Heroku by typing: `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get(SECRET_KEY)`
* Comment out the `DATABASES` section in settings.py and replace with:
```
DATABASES = {
  'default': 
  dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }`
```
* Create a Cloudinary account and from the 'Dashboard' in Cloudinary copy your url into the env.py file by typing: `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://<insert-your-url>"`
* In Heroku  add cloudinary url to 'config vars'
* In Heroku config vars add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with value of '1' (note: this must be removed for final deployment)
* Add Cloudinary libraries to the installed apps section of settings.py file:
 ```
 'cloudinary_storage'
 'django.contrib.staticfiles''
 'cloudinary'
 ```
* Connect Cloudinary to the Django app in `settings.py`:
```
STATIC_URL = '/static'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'STATIC')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE =
'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
* Link file to the templates directory in Heroku 
* Place under the BASE_DIR: TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,
'templates')
```
* Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR. Place within the TEMPLATES array: `'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`
* Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS: ```ALLOWED_HOSTS =
['rhi-book-nook.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']```
*Create Procfile at the top level of the file structure and insert the following:
    ``` web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi ```

* Make an initial commit and push the code to the GitHub Repository.
    ```git add .```
    ```git commit -m "Initial deployment"```
    ```git push```

### 5. Heroku Deployment: 
* Click Deploy tab in Heroku
* In the 'Deployment method' section select 'Github' and click the 'connect to Github' button to confirm.
* In the 'search' box enter the Github repository name for the project
* Click search and then click connect to link the heroku app with the Github repository. The box will confirm that heroku is connected to the repository.

### 6. Final Deployment
In the IDE: 
* When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in `settings.py` 
* In Heroku settings config vars change the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC value to 0
* Because DEBUG must be switched to True for development and False for production it is recommended that only manual deployment is used in Heroku. 
* To manually deploy click the button 'Deploy Branch'. The default 'main' option in the dropdown menu should be selected in both cases. When the app is deployed a message 'Your app was successfully deployed' will be shown. Click 'view' to see the deployed app in the browser.

## To fork the repository on GitHub

A copy of the GitHub Repository can be made by forking the GitHub account. Changes can be made on this copy without affecting the original repository.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the repository in question.
2. Locate the Fork button which can be found in the top corner, right-hand side of the page, inline with the repository name.
3. Click this button to create a copy of the original repository in your GitHub Account.

## To clone the repository on GitHub

1. Click on the code button which is underneath the main tab and repository name to the right.
2. In the 'Clone with HTTPS' section, click on the clipboard icon to copy the URL.
3. Open Git Bash in your IDE of choice.
4. Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be made.
5. Type git clone, and then paste the URL copied from GitHub.
6. Press enter and the clone of your repository will be created.
